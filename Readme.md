# Depressed Project Proposal. 

Hello, are you depressed? In pain betrayed that you no longer have any motivation to do anything and wish you can k!ll yourself but can't? don't worry I am the same. 

I would like to invite you to join me to try once more, hoping that we all can get over this! if you are struggling and seems all hope is gone, let's try something to at least we can try something. 

**I would be preparing my pitch...**

you feel shitty? then I invite you to please join me because I would like to create a cryptocurrency project. 
a cryptocurrency token for us broken people, but I lack the funds to support the development, so I would like to ask for maybe 100 people with the same situation to provide or donate at least $10 and join this discord server so we can converse add this lingering problems. 

I will be accepting cryptocurrency or via paypal, in this address, and please join the [discord server](https://discord.gg/vcVty46Z) to get noticed and if you use PayPal please send this to my [email](mailto:kainkent69@gmail.com) and provide your wallet address to the message so that I will know where to send the tokens because 60% of all token supply will be equally devided to everyone provided the funds. 

I would be spending my time to build an ecosystem for this project where the token will be useful even if it can never be successful we can just try. 

## I will be providing a simple roadmap. that will be followed if I can raise at least <u>$1000</u>.  

## phase 1. token development and pre-distribution. 

I will be building a token and launch it on network we agreed upon, where 60% of all total supply will be devided by the people who provided funds but a single individual will only receive up to 1% of the token supply. where 20% will be kept for development and future growth, the 10% of the total supply will be used to liquidity and the remaining 5% will be given away to others to gain userbase. 

## phase 2. Airdrop and a site and liquidity provision. 

I will be making a site to distribute 5% of all token to others, and a site where they can use the token to purchase, to play games and invite others a basic strategy for traction. Where I will be using 5% of total supply and provide 10% of token supply and 20% of the funds for liquidity so that users can sell the tokens they recieve. and I will be providing liquidity and price the token at least 10X the initial valuation. 


## phase 3: continues development. 
I will be developing and building the project ecosystem to use this token as a utility, the development will contineu until it matured.
